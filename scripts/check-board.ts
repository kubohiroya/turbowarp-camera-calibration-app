/**
 * Asks the pinned detector whether it can find the board this app prints.
 *
 * The two halves of the calibration are drawn in one repository and found in
 * another: the SVG here, the ChArUco detector in the extension. Nothing was
 * checking that they agree. They did agree -- but nobody knew that, and a
 * change to either side would have been discovered by an operator standing in
 * front of a camera being told to show a board they were already holding.
 *
 * It runs in a browser because that is the only place the question can be
 * asked. OpenCV registers its API through embind when the WebAssembly module
 * initializes, so reading either file proves nothing, and the module does not
 * finish initializing under Node.
 *
 * Two properties, not one:
 *
 * Every board is found in full by its own detector. That is the contract.
 *
 * No board is found at all by another board's detector. That one is not
 * obvious -- all three boards draw markers from the same dictionary, numbered
 * from zero, so a smaller board's markers are a subset of a larger one's and a
 * partial match is imaginable. Measured, it does not happen: a mismatched
 * board yields no corners rather than a few wrong ones. Worth pinning, because
 * a few wrong ones would be a calibration that solves and is wrong, with a
 * small reprojection error saying nothing is amiss.
