 * Geometry lives here rather than in the markup so that the printed sheet, the
 * full-screen view and the saved file are the same board.

 * the edge of the frame still be used: the markers name the corners around
 * them, where a plain chessboard has to be found whole because nothing in it
 * says which corner is which. The corners near the frame edge are the ones that
 * decide the principal point and the distortion, so being able to keep those
 * views matters more than it sounds.
